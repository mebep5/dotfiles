In the repository, we have multiple folders to look at. First, we have a bash script that is used to backup and replace your .bashrc file as well as a vimrc install script. 
Next, we have a script to install ansible. This is a manager for configuration, deploying software, and orchestra workflows. 

To clone this repo and utilize the scripts in this repo, you'll need to clone with ssh normally. Next, you will change the permissions of each file to 600 and run the script for it to take effect. This should work if you have the files in your home directory otherwise, you will need to change the file paths.
I wish to improve the README instructions for the tasks as this is a non-informative example of what I have to offer on this repository.
