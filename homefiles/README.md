Below are what my files do.

My .bashrc file is just a copy of my original .bashrc file so we could copy this and link it to my actual .bashrc file. The aliases that were added were ".." which shortens the "cd .." command and also the "clr" alias which shortens the "clear" command. These are very simple to understand and just make it quality of life to use the terminal more fluently.

The script I used was created using ChatGPT. The prompt was "write a script that links the .bashrc file in my dotfiles repository and create a backup of my .bashrc file."
This script accurately connects the repositories .bashrc file to my actual .bashrc file so it stays upto date whenever I run the script. I plan on messing with my aliases some more but that will be a personal endeavor so this will be all for the assignment.
